# Submitting Pull Requests
Pull requests are very welcome to this project, however I have a couple of guidelines that should be followed when submitting a pull request.

## Code Styling
Please use clang-format before performing any pull requests. Use the .clang-format file in this repo.


## Branching
Please make branch names `develop/brief-description` and include a full description of what the fixes and features are included. All commits should be run through the clang-format first, not following opening the PR.
